# Python Bot/CLI to do my work for me.

`remove-all.py` is the main file that is used to remove the old dashbboard.
`check-files.py` is used to scan the entire old dashbboard directory and what `blade` files are not repeated and can be deleted once the old one is gone. This is also included in the main python script when going through it tells me which ones I need to remove.

## Description

So basically, I had to remove an older version of the dashboard and I kept making tiny mistakes because it was such a boring job. Although I got to explore what each page was, I was having the issue of making tiny mistakes bacause it was so repetative.

I then created a python bot to do it for me. I created it following the exact same steps that I was given. I automated it with a CLI giving me promts asking where to go, what to do, what to delete.

I can just chill with the terminal and do my work. :D

## In conclusion

By me doing this project, I not only learned a ton about python (as I have only made a rock, paper, scissors game in it) but I also found small things which I missed while deleting the old dashboard.

## NOTICE

This is a public project to show off my work, however it will not work for anyone as they do not have the software I was editing, and if they do it might be different location.
